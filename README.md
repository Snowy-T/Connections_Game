# NYT-Inspired Connections Game in Java and SQL
This repository implements the popular word association game "Connections," inspired by the [New York Times Games](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections). Here, you'll find a Java-based game with a backend database managed by SQL.

## Project Goal

This project aims to recreate the "Connections" experience using Java for the game logic and SQL for managing the word associations and game state. 

Through this, we aim to:

 - Practice core Java programming concepts.
 - Understand database interaction with SQL.
 - Explore game design principles for a word association game.

## Gameplay
Connections presents a daily puzzle where you need to find relationships between sets of words. The objective is to group 16 provided words into four categories of four words each, all sharing a specific connection.
